## Q: 1

### Objective

Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset.

### Dataset

**Kaggle Dataset**: California Housing Prices

* 20,640 samples with 8 features
* Target: Median house value in hundreds of thousands of dollars

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Data Exploration

* Load the dataset and examine its structure
* Check for missing values and outliers
* Create a correlation heatmap between features
* Generate scatter plots for key feature relationships

#### Task 2: Data Preprocessing

* Handle missing values (if any)
* Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
* Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Create polynomial features for at least one variable

#### Task 3: Model Implementation

* Implement linear regression using scikit-learn
* Train the model on training data
* Make predictions on the test set
* Compare with a Ridge regression model (alpha=1.0)

#### Task 4: Analysis & Insights

* Identify the most important features
* Discuss model limitations
* Suggest improvements for better performance

### Deliverables

* Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
* Brief report (1â€“2 pages) summarizing findings
* Model performance comparison table

**Submission Format**: `.ipynb` file + PDF report
